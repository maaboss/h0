I hace create a simple "hello world" java file and compiled it.

public class HelloWorld {
    
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}

UNfortunately the compilation did not work since my new device does no have have the java jdk installed. It would take a while to. But the code ran on VS code and gave the correct output.
